# Lang
A Simple programing language im working on....<br>
The file ending is `.l` <br>
<br><br>
My code isnt good...
<br>


## Syntax
At the end of a line you write `;` <br>
There are a few "commands": 
```
# <- Comment
put <string>                <- Write something to the console
sys <command>               <- Execute terminal command
fw  <filename> <content>    <- Write stuff to a file
fr  <filename>              <- Read file content
```
